              <p>Diamond Inclusions is the first book ever published that is devoted entirely to inclusions; their size, position, quantity, type, color and how they affect the finished diamond. It covers not only external and internal
                characteristics but documents and tracks diamond inclusions from the rough crystal to the fully faceted gem product. Five rough gem diamonds ranging in size from 4.72cts to 17.58cts are documented in this manner. Additionally, diamond
                inclusions are further examined in a separate section on how they are affected during the sawing, bruting and polishing processes. It discusses how heat, pressure, friction, diamond powder and other mechanical areas that may affect
                certain types of diamond inclusions.</p>

b. Inclusions developing because of stress and strain

As discussed previously, stress and strain in a diamond is very often unseen and is only realized when an inclusion develops for no apparent reason. If detected by using the polariscope, the bruter will use more caution during bruting but this is quite beyond his control if inclusions do develop.

The forcing process that is used in bruting, if tension exist in one or more areas of the bruted surface, inclusions will suddenly develop due to the release of tension. The type of inclusions that develop are often feather type inclusions that trail from the bruted surface to varying depths internally. Sometimes as the brutting process continues, the inclusions can open or break away from the brutted surface creating pits, nicks and cavities.

c. Inclusions produced by the bruter

During the bruting process, the bruter can sometimes press the industrial too hard against the gem diamond that is being brutted and thereby create a rough girdle. A rough girdle is where minute feather inclusions develop that extend from girdle surface to microscopic short distances.">

            Internal features can occur in many different varieties and shapes. They can be classified into four general categories.<br><br>
